# HumemAI Research

HumemAI Research explores **human-like memory systems** for AI — combining **episodic** (experience-based) and **semantic** (knowledge-based) memory models.

We study how machines can store, retrieve, and reason over structured memory graphs built from text, tables, and user interactions.

## Research Areas

- **Episodic Memory:** Representing conversations and experiences as temporal property graphs.  
- **Semantic Memory:** Integrating user-provided or external data (e.g. Wikidata, Wikipedia) into graph, table, and vector formats.  
- **Memory Management:** Learning what to remember, summarize, or forget across time.  
- **Graph-Based Reasoning:** Querying and updating symbolic–neural hybrid memories.  
- **Reinforcement Learning & Knowledge Graphs:** Using RL to induce hierarchies and explore knowledge structures.
